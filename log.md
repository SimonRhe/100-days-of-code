# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 8: 2019-08-17

**Today's Tweet:** Day 8: It was a busy Saturday but I managed to solve 2 HackerRank problems: one using a RegEx and another manipulating JavaScript arrays. #100daysofcode

**Projects worked on:** HackerRank

**Thoughts:** Used a JavaScript object to count the number times an item occurs in an array--simple and it worked but for some reason I thought I had tried it before and it hadn't worked.

**Ideas for improvement:** Maybe do some JavaScript exercices specifically on objects?



### Day 7: 2019-08-16

**Today's Tweet:** Day 7: tried to better organize a personal project I'm working on by wireframing a minimum viable product, and then started coding the interface in HTML & CSS. ‚ùì Does anyone know of a simple web app dev methodology that describes the steps from design to shipping? #100daysofcode

**Projects worked on:** Have a Nice Day web app - weekly plan

**Thoughts:** I think the MVP I developed will be useful at least for me! But in the end it looks like a spreadsheet so is it worth the effort?

**Ideas for improvement:** Look up how to use multiple CSS classes on a grid for table-like behavior.




### Day 6: 2019-08-14

**Today's Tweet:** Day 6: Back to basics! Created a new page framework for an app using HTML and CSS grid, brushed up on Emmet to make my job easier https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/ and uploaded to GitHub through the VS Code plug-in. Feeling great! üòÄ #100daysofcode

**Projects worked on:** Have a Nice Day web app - created HTML and CSS framework for weekly plan

**Thoughts:** Great to be working on a project that will be useful to me! I must determine what's my minimum viable product features and focus on those so I can really use it.

**Ideas for improvement:** Look up and follow a web development methodology that will take me through the steps in the right oder: user story, wireframe, etc.



### Day 5: 2019-08-09

**Today's Tweet:** Day 5: I finally got back to coding after moving our family from Austria üá¶üáπ to Brazil üáßüá∑! Partially solved a HackerRank problem in JavaScript but got a "terminated due to timeout" on the larger test cases--will try not to go through entire array every time! #100daysofcode

**Projects worked on:** HackerRank

**Thoughts:** It was hard today!... Not enough practice I guess.

**Ideas for improvement:** More consistency.



### Day 4: 2019-07-29

**Today's Tweet:** Day 4 after a long break (it's summer!): worked hard to solve an "easy" @HackerRank problem and came to the conclusion that the test cases don't match the problem statement. Posted for the first time on the discussion board, let's see what others think! https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/divisible-sum-pairs/forum/comments/612727 #100daysofcode

**Projects worked on:** HackerRank

**Thoughts:** Did this in the middle of the night to be productive in spite of insomnia...

**Ideas for improvement:** Less HackerRank, more projects!


### Day 3: 2019-07-17

**Today's Tweet:** Day 3: Copied a project I had started on CodePen to my local dev environment to test it, and solved a HackerRank problem. #100daysofcode

**Projects worked on:** HackerRank, Setup

**Link to work:** [My HackerRank Profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/SimonRhe)

**Thoughts:** Tired today, but still did a little bit!

**Ideas for improvement:** I need to get better a blocking my time to get more programming done.


### Day 2: 2019-07-16

**Today's Tweet:** Day 2: Limited time today but managed to solve a HackerRank problem and set up Git in VS Code [Using Version Control in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol) #100daysofcode

**Projects worked on:** HackerRank, Setup

**Link to work:** [My HackerRank Profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/SimonRhe)

**Thoughts:** I'm happy I could at least do some programming! 

**Ideas for improvement:** I'll continue seting up VS Code and my dev environment, and will create a simplme web project on which I can work when I have limited time. 


### Day 1: 2019-07-15

**Today's Tweet:** I'm starting the #100daysofcode challenge! Day 1: Solved a @HackerRank RegEx challenge, improved my VS @Code setup and completed tutorial [Develop web applications with Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/develop-web-apps-with-vs-code/)

**Projects worked on:** HackerRank, Tutorials, Setup

**Link to work:** [My HackerRank Profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/SimonRhe)

**Thoughts:** It's always hard to get started when you sit down at the computer. Doing a simple HackerRank problem helped me get going. I need to improve my dev environment to be more productive so I did a VS Code tutorial and downloaded a few extensions.

**Ideas for improvement:** Continue to set up my dev environment.
