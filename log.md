# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2019-07-15

**Today's Tweet:** I'm starting the #100daysofcode challenge! Day 1: Solved a @HackerRank RegEx challenge, improved my VS @Code setup and completed tutorial [Develop web applications with Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/develop-web-apps-with-vs-code/)

**Projects worked on:** HackerRank, Tutorials

**Link to work:** [My HackerRank Profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/SimonRhe)

**Thoughts:** It's always hard to get started when you sit down at the computer. Doing a simple HackerRank problem helped me get going. I need to improve my dev environment to be more productive so I did a VS Code tutorial and downloaded a few extensions.

**Ideas for improvement:** Continue to set up my dev environment.
